_Description:_

* A series of routines for exploratory analysis of ceramic compositions 
* Designed for fully reproducible research
* It is applied on two datasets: well knwon Roman-British Pottery publisehd by Tubb et al.(1980) and secondly to new data from northern Iberian Peninsula pottery production centers
* Based on M.J. Baxter and Jaume Buxeda i Garrigos variation matrix
* Includes data visualization tools and robust statistical treatments
* To use with a new dataset change the name of the csv file and run the code on each Rmarkdown file            included in the floowing folders and following the order:
           01_Exploration
           02_Group_creation
           03_Output
