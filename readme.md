__Description:__

* A series of routines for exploratory analysis of ceramic compositions 
* Designed for fully reproducible research
* It is applied on two datasets: well known Roman-British Pottery published by Tubb et al.(1980) and secondly to new data from northern Iberian Peninsula pottery production centers
* Based on M.J. Baxter and Jaume Buxeda i Garrigós variation matrix
* Includes data visualization tools and robust statistical treatments
* To use with a new dataset change the name of the csv file and run the code on each Rmarkdown file, included in the following folders and following the order:

         * 01_Exploration

         * 02_Group_creation

         * 03_Output
